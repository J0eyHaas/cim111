          <p> Pictured above from left to right: Claudia Seluski, Mel Joy, Sporty Spice, and Nina Huynh. As you can see, I get my style from a variety of different people. I love looking to see what my favorite YouTubers are wearing since I mainly follow fashion bloggers who love to explore their ownn style. I get clothing inspiration from edgier people since I like being bold sometimes too. I'd say my style is very cute-sporty, which is why Sporty Spice is up there, but I'm also pretty eclectic, just like the women here. I like to be comfy while also wearing fun pieces like camo pants. Finding style inspiration is important when trying to explore your own style because you can then learn what you like and what you don't like on other people. I always see new cool clothing pieces on these women and want to try new things for myself. They help give me confidence to have fun with my style and not get caught up wearing the same things over and over.</p>
