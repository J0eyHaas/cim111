          <p>The first trend to look out for heading into the Winter/Spring is layering. This might seem like an obvious trend given the cooler temps, but this trend involves layering more than you'd thing to layer. Mix and match patters to layer with one another and be bold with the colors you stack. Basically, the bulkier the look, the better. Wearers of this trend can't be afaid to look larger than usual and sweat a little bit along the way.</p>

          <p>The second trend I've been noticing a lot of in high end fashion as well as street style is the check pattern. For this trend, I'd suggest sprucing up any outfit with some check to not only bring holiday vibes, but a 1990's Clueless feel to any look.
          It makes you stand out in a professional and daring way at the same time. You can put two different check patterns together and your look is still clean and sophisticated without losing the fun.</p>

        <div id="col6">
          <p>The third and final trend to be aware of this Winter/Spring is bringing back the 1960's. From sweater vests to train conductor hats, this trend is a blast from the past that nobody's upset about. It's a old and new look all wrapped into one. Wearers can look edgy while looking like your favorite grandma too. A big thing to note with this trend is that chunky belts, knit patterns and corderoy are all things that have become particularly popular. </p>
